# blockits
Blockits is a Platformer game made in Gamemaker Studio 2.

In this real simple project I wanted to deal with the GameMaker physics making a platformer game, implementing a gravity system, a pixel perfect collision system, a simple state machine, and a basic movement method for the player.
